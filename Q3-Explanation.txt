Multistage Graph Algorithm
A multistage graph is a directed graph with the vertices are divided into stages, edges going from one stage to other. Each edge has its own cost. There is 1 vertex at the start and at the end.
Findig the minimum cost path from the start vertex to the end vertex is the aim of this algorithm.

Example:
Vertices: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6  
Stages: 
Stage 1: 1
Stage 2: 2, 3
Stage 3: 4, 5
Stage 4: 6
Edges with weights:
1 → 2 : 2
1 → 3 : 4
2 → 4 : 7
2 → 5 : 3
3 → 4 : 2
3 → 5 : 5
4 → 6 : 1
5 → 6 : 2
Here for these specifics the minimum cost path is 1 → 2 → 5 → 6.

Complexity:
Each has to be traversed once. So the Time complexity becomes O(edges) or worst case O(n2).
